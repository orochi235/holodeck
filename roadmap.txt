AGENT
	CoreStats
	
"Aspects" - mix-ins that add attributes, etc. to an agent.
	Lists that can be added to (or modified?)
		- Core stats - have cap and current value, can be derived from other core stats
			
			// TODO: support for continuous and boolean stats
			
		- Actions
		- Methods - basically, public interfaces to an agent
		- Attributes - not sure what this entails, exactly, but inventory would be an example
		- Abilities - actions
		- Needs - linear values expressing how badly an agent needs a particular thing at the moment
			- id
			- floor/ceil
			- incrementation mechanism
			- behaviors triggered by threshold
		- Effects (passive) - a layer of modifiers applied to base stats, etc. (e.g. a 10% hp buff)
		- DEPENDENCIES - how to handle?
